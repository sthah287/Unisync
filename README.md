UniSync is a sample web application designed to help students academically. The key features of this application are:
search engine to search notes and research papers related to your major.
discussion forums to present your problems to your university community.
Peer mentoring features connecting juniors with like-minded and enthusiastic seniors.

This is just a beta version of our web application. We sure will be working on this and adding more features, like health and finance, to it.
