          <h3>1) Learning Resources:</span></h3>
          <p class="lead my-4">
            Learning resources are a diverse range of materials used to enhance the teaching and learning process. They are designed to 
            stimulate learners' interest, facilitate understanding, and promote active engagement with the subject matter. These resources 
            that are not easily available on one place, but with the help of a search engine, we are providing notes of almost all majors in a 
            single place. This will help students to obtain quality notes and research papers from a single search making learning more 
            accessible, fun, and interactive.<a href = "learningresources.html">Click here for more</a>

        Discussion forums are online platforms where participants can engage in threaded discussions on various topics. These forums    
        allow students to pose questions, share ideas, and respond to others' contributions, creating a dynamic and interactive environment for 
        knowledge exchange.We have developed this Discussion forum to provide an opportunity for virtual conversations that can occur
        at any time and from any location, fostering a sense of community and continuous engagement.<a href ="discussionforums.html">Click here for more</a>

      <h3>3) Peer Mentoring:</span></h3>
      <p class="lead my-4">
        Peer mentoring is a supportive relationship between individuals of similar ages or experience levels, where they work together to 
        promote mutual growth. This relationship is less formal than traditional mentoring, yet structured to ensure mutual benefits. A peer 
        mentor acts as a friend, coach, and companion, providing support, advice, and serving as a resource for inspiration and new 
        opportunities. Peer mentoring can occur one-on-one or in a group setting, and it often evolves into a co-learning environment.
        We are focusing on peer mentoring to help students get their concepts clear with the help of their seniors. <a href = "peermentoring.html">Click here for more</a>
